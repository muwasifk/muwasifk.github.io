Hey! 

My name is Muhammad Wasif Kamran, but I usually go by Wasif. You might recognize the handles I use often - `muwasifk`, `ntx`, `isogonally parallel` or some similar variations. 

I am currently an IB2 student at Merivale High School planning on taking 
- HL: Math AA, Physics, Chemistry, English
- SL: History, French 

I love problem solving and have participated in numerous mathematics and informatics competitions, even qualifying for the 2023 AIME. This hobby has led me to spend some of the past few years working on the UCT, and now the OTMaC. 

You can view some of the [projects](/projects) I have worked on, and also my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf).
